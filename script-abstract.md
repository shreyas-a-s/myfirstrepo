## Abstract of what one-click tripal install script does

### First Draft:
This script written in Bash works on Debian 11 systems and sets up a working tripal 3 website by taking user inputs at different stages of execution. First it installs postgreSQL and sets up a Database for use by Drupal. Then it installs apache and php dependencies. Then it installs Drupal with some extra modules like Webform to help user get started faster. Tripal is then installed and enabled along with tripal_chado (which is needed for storing biological data) and tripal_daemon (for automatic execution of tripal tasks). Then it installs BLAST+ and tripal_blast with a sample blast database setup that enables users to test out it's functionality by inputting a FASTA file or a FASTA sequence. It also installs and enables JBrowse and links it to Tripal by using module called tripal_jbrowse. Along the way of execution, script also fixes some bugs present when installing tripal 3, drush, etc. which we identified during the course of creation of the script as well as while working with Drupal and Tripal. Script also deploys some error detection and correction methods so that even in case of any errors, the installation of Tripal and dependencies won't fail. Instead of just relying on Linux Command-Line Interface (which won't be comfortable for many users), our script makes clever use of a program called whiptail to provide users a legible User Interface that is understandable by even the non-tech-savvy audience.

### Second Draft:
"This Bash script is designed for Debian 11 systems. It sets up a working Tripal 3 website by prompting users for inputs at different stages of execution. Firstly, it installs PostgreSQL and configures a database for use by Drupal. It then proceeds to install Apache and necessary PHP dependencies. Following this, it installs Drupal, integrating additional modules such as Webform to expedite the user's initial setup. Subsequently, the script installs and activates Tripal, along with its prerequisites, Tripal_Chado (essential for storing biological data) and Tripal_Daemon (for automating Tripal tasks). It also incorporates the installation of BLAST+ and Tripal_Blast, including a pre-configured blast database, allowing users to test its functionality by providing a FASTA file or sequence.

Furthermore, the script deploys JBrowse, seamlessly linking it to Tripal through the 'Tripal_JBrowse' module. Throughout the execution process, the script addresses various bugs identified during the script's development and while working with Drupal and Tripal. It also implements error detection and correction methods to ensure a smooth installation process, even in the event of errors. 

To enhance user-friendliness, the script leverages the 'whiptail' program, offering users a clear and understandable graphical user interface, thereby catering to a non-technical audience."
